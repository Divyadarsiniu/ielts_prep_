# IELTS PREPARATION 

## Overview

This repository contains a UX prototype for a gamified IELTS preparation experience inspired by Duolingo-style level progression.
The goal of this prototype is to improve learning consistency, motivation, and visible progress during long IELTS preparation cycles.

The product focuses on behavior change over content volume, helping users stay engaged through small daily wins, streaks, and milestone-based rewards.

## Problem Statement

Many IELTS aspirants drop off during preparation due to:

Lack of visible progress

Low motivation over long preparation timelines

Overwhelming study plans

Poor alignment with exam, university application, and visa deadlines

This prototype addresses these issues by converting preparation into a game-like, time-aware learning journey.

## Deployment
- npm i
- npm run dev
  

## Core Concept

Preparation is broken into daily micro-learning levels

Each day represents a level

Completing daily tasks unlocks the next level

Weekly consistency unlocks mock tests or advanced modules

Progress is aligned with exam date, university application deadlines, and visa expiry date

## Key Features
1. Duolingo-Style Learning Timeline

Vertical, game-like path with connected levels

Each level = one day of preparation

Completed levels are highlighted

Current level is emphasized

Future levels remain locked

2. Daily Level Completion

Each day includes:

Short concept video

Audio-based listening task

5–10 practice questions

Completing all tasks:

Marks the day as “Level Completed”

Unlocks the next day’s level

Continues the learning streak

3. Weekly Milestones & Rewards

Completing all daily levels in a week unlocks:

A full mock test paper, or

An advanced concept module

Encourages medium-term motivation beyond daily streaks

4. Deadline-Aware Progress Planning

The timeline dynamically adapts based on:

IELTS exam date

University application deadlines

Visa expiry date

As deadlines approach:

Learning intensity increases

Mock tests and revisions are prioritized

5. Recovery-Friendly Streak System

Missing a day does not reset all progress

Users are offered lighter recovery tasks

Prevents guilt-driven abandonment
